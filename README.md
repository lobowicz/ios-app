App I would like to build:
**MentalWell - Your Compass to Mental Health in Africa**
Mental health is a significant and growing concern across my home continent Africa. It is largely ignored because of stigma, lack of awareness, conflict, trauma, and limited access to mental health services, but I would like to change this. MentalWell will be a mobile application designed to empower individuals across Africa in managing their mental health. The mission is to bridge the gap between those in need and accessible resources, ensuring a smoother journey towards well-being. The key features of the app include:
- a user friendly map interface that locates hospitals and pharmacies nearby with medications users search for, with real-time medication prices
- an extensive database of mental health medications, including detailed information about each drug, its uses, and potential side effects. 
- a community support hub that connects with others facing similar challenges, to share experiences, find encouragement, and build a network of support within the MentalWell community.
- a professional locator that suggests nearby healthcare professionals and facilities best suited for user needs
- appointment scheduler that streamlines the process of booking appointments with these professionals
- multilingual support to ensure more people have access to the app
- emergency assistance button that is a widget added to users' home screens that connects users to local crisis helplines and services when pressed.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
